      THE LOST GUIDON

    <p>
      Night came early. It might well seem that day had fled affrighted. The
      heavy masses of clouds, glooming low, which had gathered thicker and
      thicker, as if crowding to witness the catastrophe, had finally shaken
      asunder in the concussions of the air at the discharges of artillery, and
      now the direful rain, always sequence of the shock of battle, was steadily
      falling, falling, on the stricken field. Many a soldier who might have
      survived his wounds would succumb to exposure to the elements during the
      night, debarred the tardy succor that must needs await his turn. One of
      the surgeons at their hasty work at the field hospital, under the shelter
      of the cliffs on the slope, paused to note the presage of doom and death,
      and to draw a long breath before he adjusted himself anew to the grim
      duties of the scalpel in his hand. His face was set and haggard, less with
      a realization of the significance of the scene&mdash;for he was used to
      its recurrence&mdash;than simply with a physical reflection of horror, as
      if it were glassed in a mirror. A phenomenon that had earlier caught his
      attention in the landscape appealed again to his notice, perhaps because
      the symptom was not in his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like a case of dementia,&rdquo; he observed to the senior surgeon,
      standing near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The superior officer adjusted his field-glass. &ldquo;Looks like 'Death on the
      White Horse'!&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the highway, at a slow pace, rode a cavalryman wearing a gray
      uniform, with a sergeant's chevrons, and mounted on a steed good in his
      day, but whose day was gone. A great clot of blood had gathered on his
      broad white chest, where a bayonet had thrust him deep. Despite his
      exhaustion, he moved forward at the urgency of his rider's heel and hand.
      The soldier held a long, heavy staff planted on one stirrup, from the top
      of which drooped in the dull air the once gay guidon, battle-rent and
      sodden with rain, and as he went he shouted at intervals, &ldquo;Dovinger's
      Bangers! Rally on the guidon!&rdquo; Now and again his strident boyish voice
      varied the appeal, &ldquo;Hyar's yer Dov-inger's Rangers! Bally, boys! Rally on
      the reserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, despite his stalwart, tall, broad-shouldered frame, he was
      scarcely more than a boy. His bare head had flaxen curls like a child's;
      his pallid, though sunburned face was broad and soft and beardless; his
      large blue eyes were languid and spiritless, though now and then as he
      turned an intent gaze over the field they flared anew with hope, as if he
      expected to see rise up from that desolate expanse, from among the
      stiffening carcasses of horses and the stark corpses of the troopers, that
      gallant squadron wont to follow, so dashing and debonair, wherever the
      guidons might mark the way. But there was naught astir save the darkness
      slipping down by slow degrees&mdash;and perchance under its cloak, already
      stealthily afoot, the ghoulish robbers of the dead that haunt the track of
      battle. They were the human forerunners of the vulture breed, with even a
      keener scent for prey, for as yet the feathered carrion-seekers held
      aloof; two or three only were descried from the field hospital, perched on
      the boughs of a dead tree near the river, presently joined by another, its
      splendid sustained flight impeded somewhat by the rain, battling with its
      big, strong wings against the downpour of the torrents and the heavy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still through all echoed the cry, &ldquo;Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's
      Rangers! Rally on the reserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bridge that crossed the river, which was running full and foaming, had
      been burnt; but a span, charred and broken, still swung from the central
      pier. Over toward the dun-tinted west a house was blazing, fired by some
      stray bomb, perhaps, or by official design, to hinder the enemy from
      utilizing the shelter, and its red rage of destruction bepainted the
      clouds that hung so low above the chimneys and dormer-windows. To the
      east, the woods on the steeps had been shelled, and a myriad boughs and
      boles riven and rent, lay in fantastic confusion. Through the mournful
      chaos the wind had begun to sweep; it sounded in unison with the battle
      clamors, and shrieked and wailed and roared as it surged adown the
      defiles. Now and then there came on the blast the fusillade of dropping
      shots from the south, where the skirmish line of one faction engaged the
      rear-guard of the other, or the pickets fell within rifle-range. Once the
      sullen, melancholy boom of distant cannon shook the clouds, and then was
      still, and ever and again sounded that tireless cry, &ldquo;Dovinger's Rangers.
      Hyar's yer guidon! Rally, boys! Rally on the guidon! Rally on the
      reserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senior surgeon, as the road wound near, stepped down toward it when
      the horseman, still holding himself proudly erect, passed by. &ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo;
       he hailed the guidon, &ldquo;where is Captain Dovinger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand mechanically went to the boy's forehead in the usual military
      salute. &ldquo;Killed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the other officers of the squadron&mdash;the junior captain,
      the lieutenants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of the troopers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed, sir, in the last charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Then Dr. Trent broke forth: &ldquo;Are you a fool, boy? If
      your command is annihilated, why do you keep up this commotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow looked blank for a moment. Then, as if he had not
      reasoned on the catastrophe: &ldquo;I thought at first they monght be scattered&mdash;some
      of 'em. But ef&mdash;ef&mdash;they <i>war</i> dead, but could once <i>see</i>
      the guidon, sure 't would call 'em to life. They <i>couldn't</i> be so
      dead but they would rally to the guidon! Guide right!&rdquo; he shouted
      suddenly. &ldquo;Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the guidon, boys! Rally on the
      reserve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a time that hardened men's hearts. The young soldier had no
      physical hurt that might appeal to the professional sympathies of the
      senior surgeon, and he turned away with a half laugh. &ldquo;Let him go along!
      He can't rally Dovinger's Rangers this side of the river Styx, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But an old chaplain who had been hovering about the field hospital,
      whispering a word here and there to stimulate the fortitude of the wounded
      and solace the fears of the dying, recognized moral symptoms alien to any
      diagnosis of which the senior surgeon was capable. The latter did not
      deplore the diversion of interest, for the old man's presence was not
      highly esteemed by the hospital corps at this scene of hasty and terrible
      work, although, having taken a course in medicine in early life, he was
      permitted to aid in certain ways. But the surgeons were wont to declare
      that the men began to bleat at the very sight of the chaplain. So gentle,
      so sympathetic, so paternal, was he that they made the more of their
      wretched woes, seeing them so deeply deplored. The senior surgeon,
      moreover, was not an ardent religionist. &ldquo;This is no time for a revival,
      Mr. Whitmel,&rdquo; he would insist. &ldquo;Jack, there, never spoke the name of God
      in his life, except to swear by it. He is too late for prayers, and if <i>I</i>
      can't pull him through, he is a goner!&rdquo; But the chaplain was fond of
      quoting:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Between the stirrup and the ground
     He mercy sought and mercy found&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and sometimes the scene was irreverently called a &ldquo;love feast&rdquo; when some
      hard-riding, hard-swearing, hard-fighting, unthinking sinner went joyfully
      out of this world from the fatherly arms of the chaplain into the paternal
      embrace of an eternal and merciful Father, as the man of God firmly
      believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood now, staring after the guidon borne through the rain and the
      mist, flaunting red as the last leaves of autumn against the dun-tinted
      dusk, that the dead might view the gallant and honored pennant and rise
      again to its leading!
    </p>
    <p>
      No one followed but the tall, thin figure of the gaunt old chaplain,
      unless indeed the trooping shadows that kept him company had mysteriously
      roused at the stirring summons. Lanterns were now visible, dimly
      flickering in one quarter where the fighting had been furious and the
      slain lay six deep on the ground. Their aspirations, their valor, their
      patriotism, had all exhaled&mdash;volatile essences, these incomparable
      values!&mdash;and now their bodies, weighted with death, cumbered the
      earth. They must be hurried out of sight, out of remembrance soon, and the
      burial parties were urged to diligence at the trenches where these
      cast-off semblances were to lie undistinguished together. And still the
      reflection of the burning house reddened the gloomy west, and still the
      cry, &ldquo;Rally on the guidon! Dovinger's Rangers!&rdquo; smote the thick air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it was silent. The white horse that had been visible in the flare
      from the flaming house, now and again flung athwart the landscape, no
      longer loomed in the vista of the shadowy road. He had given way at last,
      sinking down with that martial figure still in the saddle, and, with no
      struggle save a mere galvanic shiver, passing away from the scene of his
      faithful devoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigue, agitation, anguish, his agonized obsession of the possibility of
      rallying the squadron, had served to prostrate the soldier's physical
      powers of resistance. He could not constrain his muscles to rise from the
      recumbent position against the carcass. He started up, then sank back, and
      in another moment triumphant nature conquered, and he was asleep&mdash;a
      dull, dreamless sleep of absolute exhaustion, that perchance rescued his
      reason as well as saved his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old chaplain was a man of infinite prejudice, steeped in all the
      infirmities and fantasies of dogma; a lover of harmony, and essentially an
      apostle of peace. Nevertheless, it would not have been physically safe to
      call him a Jesuit. But indeed he scarcely hesitated; he stepped over the
      great inert bulk of the dead horse, unclenched the muscular grasp of the
      soldier, as if it had been a baby's clasp, slipped the staff, technically
      the lance, of the guidon from its socket, and stood with it in his own
      hand, looking suspiciously to and fro to descry if perchance he were
      observed. The coast clear, he turned to the wall of rock beside the road,
      for this was near the mountain sandstone formation, fissured, splintered,
      with the erosions of water and weather; and into one of the cellular,
      tunnel-like apertures he ran the guidon, lance and all,&mdash;lost forever
      from human sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days one might speak indeed of the march of events. Each seemed
      hard on the heels of its precursor. Change ran riot in the ordering of the
      world, and its aspect was utterly transformed when Casper Girard, no
      longer bearing the guidon of Dovinger's Rangers, came out of the war with
      a captain's shoulder-straps, won by personal fitness often proved, the
      habit of command, and a great and growing opinion of himself. He was a
      changeling, so to speak. No longer he felt a native of the mountain cove
      where he had been born and reared. He had had a glimpse of the world from
      a different standpoint, and it lured him. A dreary, disaffected life he
      led for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Minds me of a wild tur-r-key in a trap,&rdquo; his mother was wont to comment.
      &ldquo;Always stretchin' his neck an' lookin' up an' away&mdash;when he mought
      git out by looking down.&rdquo; And the simile was so apt that it stayed in his
      mind&mdash;looking up and away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all dull inventions, in his estimation the art of printing exceeded. He
      had made but indifferent progress in education during his early youth; he
      was a slow and inexpert reader, and a writer whose chirography shrank from
      exhibition. Now, however, a book in the hand gave him a cherished
      sentiment of touch with the larger world beyond those blue ranges that
      limited his sphere, and he spent much time in sedulously reading certain
      volumes which he had brought home with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spent <i>money</i> fur 'em!&rdquo; his mother would ejaculate, contemplating
      this extreme audacity of extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she often observed, &ldquo;the plough-handles seemed red-hot,&rdquo; and as soon as
      political conditions favored he ran for office. On the strength of his war
      record, a potent lever in those days, he was elected register of the
      county. True, there was only a population of about fifty souls in the
      county town, and the houses were log-cabins, except the temple of justice
      itself, which was a two-story frame building. But his success was a step
      on the road to political preferment, and his ambitious eyes were on the
      future. Into the midst of his quiet incumbency as register came Fate, all
      intrusive, and found him through the infrequent medium of a weekly mail.
      It was at the beginning of the retrospective enthusiasm that has served to
      revive the memories of the War, and he received a letter from an old
      comrade-in-arms, giving the details of a brigade reunion shortly to be
      held at no great distance, and, being of the committee, inviting him to be
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Girard had participated in great military crises; he had marshalled his
      troop in line of battle; as a mere boy, he had ridden with the guidon
      lance planted on his stirrup, with the pennant flying above his head, as
      the marker to lead the fierce and famous Dov-inger Rangers into the
      thickest of the fight; yet he had never felt such palpitant tremors of
      excitement as when he stood on the hotel piazza of the New Helvetia
      Springs, where the banqueters had gathered, and suffered the ordeal of
      introduction to sundry groups of fashionable ladies. He had earlier seen
      specimens of the species in the course of military transitions through the
      cities of the lowlands, and he watched them narrowly to detect if they
      discerned perchance a difference between him and the men of education and
      social station with whom his advancement in the army had associated him.
      He did not reflect that they were too well-bred to reveal any appreciation
      of such incongruity, but he had never experienced a more ardent glow of
      gratification than upon overhearing a friend's remark: &ldquo;Girard is great!
      Anybody would imagine he was used to all this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No strategist was ever more wary. He would not undertake to dance, for he
      readily perceived that the gyrations in the ball-room were utterly
      dissimilar to the clumsy capering to which he had been accustomed on the
      puncheon floor of a mountain cabin. He had the less reason for regret
      since he was privileged instead to stroll up and down the veranda,&mdash;&ldquo;promenade&rdquo;
       was the technical term,&mdash;a slender hand, delicately gloved, on the
      sleeve of his gray uniform, the old regimentals being <i>de rigueur</i> at
      these reunions. A white ball-gown, such as he had never before seen,
      fashioned of tissue over lustrous white silk, swayed in diaphanous folds
      against him, for these were the days of voluminous draperies; a head of
      auburn hair elaborately dressed gleamed in the moonlight near his
      shoulder. Miss Alicia Duval thought him tremendously handsome; she adored
      his record, as she would have said&mdash;unaware how little of it she knew&mdash;and
      she did not so much intend to flirt as to draw him out, for there was
      something about him different from the men of her set, and it stimulated
      her interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't the moon heavenly!&rdquo; she observed, gazing at the brilliant orb, now
      near the full, swinging in the sky, which became a definite blue in its
      light above the massive dark mountains and the misty valley below; for the
      building was as near the brink as safety permitted&mdash;nearer, the
      cautious opined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavenly? Not more'n it's got a right to be. It's a heavenly body, ain't
      it?&rdquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how sarcastic!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;In what school did you acquire your
      trenchant style?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the tiny district school where he had acquired the very
      little he knew of aught, and said nothing, laughing constrainedly in lieu
      of response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music of the orchestra came, to them from the ball-room, and the
      rhythmic beat of dancing feet; the wind lifted her hair gently and brought
      to them the fragrance of flowering plants and the pungent aroma of mint
      down in the depths of the ravine hard by, where lurked a chalybeate
      spring; but for the noisy rout of the dance, and now and again the flimsy
      chatter of a passing couple on the piazza, promenading like themselves,
      they might have heard the waters of the fountain rise and bubble and break
      and sigh as the pulsating impulse beat like heart-throbs, and perchance on
      its rocky marge an oread a-singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't answer me,&rdquo; she pouted with an affectation of pettishness.
      &ldquo;Do you know that you trouble yourself to talk very little, Captain
      Girard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the more,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think? Oh, dear me! I didn't know that anybody does anything so
      unfashionable nowadays as to <i>think!</i> And what do you think about,
      pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that began it: he was a gallant man, and he had been a brave one. He
      was not aware how far he was going on so short an acquaintance, but his
      temerity was not displeasing to the lady. She liked his manner of storming
      the citadel, and she did not realize that he merely spoke at random, as
      best he might. He was in his uniform a splendid and martial presentment of
      military youth, and indeed he was much the junior of his compeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are Captain Girard's people, Papa?&rdquo; she asked Colonel Duval next
      morning, as the family party sat at breakfast in quasi seclusion at one of
      the small round tables in the crowded dining-room, full of the chatter of
      people and the clatter of dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girard?&rdquo; Colonel Duval repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;I really don't know. I
      have an impression they live somewhere in East Tennessee. I never met him
      till just about the end of the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Papa! How unsatisfactory you are! You never know anything about
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think his people must be very plain,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duval. Her
      social discrimination was extremely acute and in constant practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why. He is very much of a gentleman,&rdquo; the Colonel contended.
      His heart was warm to-day with much fraternizing, and it was not kind to
      brush the bloom off his peach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, trifles suggest the fact. He is not at all <i>au fait</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, experienced in ways of the world unimagined in her
      philosophy. The reunion had drawn to a close, ending in a flare of jollity
      and tender reminiscence and good-fellowship. The old soldiers were all
      gone save a few regular patrons of the hotel, who with their families were
      completing their summer sojourn. Captain Girard lingered, too, fascinated
      by this glimpse of the frivolous world, hitherto unimagined, rather than
      by the incense to his vanity offered by his facile acceptance as a squire
      of dames. For the first time in his life he felt the grinding lack of
      money. Being a man of resource, he set about swiftly supplying this need.
      In the dull days of inaction, when the armies lay supine and only
      occasionally the monotony was broken by the engagement of distant
      skirmishers or a picket line was driven in on the main body, he had
      learned to play a game at cards much in vogue at that period, though for
      no greater hazards than grains of corn or Confederate money, almost as
      worthless. In the realization now that the same principles held good with
      stakes of value, he seemed to enter upon the possession of a veritable
      gold mine. The peculiar traits that his one unique experience of the world
      had developed&mdash;his coolness, his courage, his discernment of
      strategic resources&mdash;stood him in good stead, and long after the
      microcosm of the hotel lay fast asleep the cards were dealt and play ran
      high in the little building called the casino, ostensibly devoted to the
      milder delights of billiards and cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either luck favored him or he had rare discrimination of relative chances
      in the run of the cards, or the phenomenally bold hand he played
      disconcerted his adversaries, but his almost invariable winning began to
      affect injuriously his character. Indeed, he was said to be a rook of
      unrivalled rapacity. Colonel Duval was in the frame of mind that his wife
      called &ldquo;bearish&rdquo; one morning as his family gathered for breakfast in the
      limited privacy of their circle about the round table in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to avoid that fellow, Alicia,&rdquo; he growled <i>sotto voce</i>,
      as he intercepted a bright matutinal smile that the fair Alicia sent as a
      morning greeting to Girard, who had just entered and taken his seat at a
      distance. &ldquo;We know nothing under heaven about his people, and he himself
      has the repute of being a desperate gambler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife raised significant eyebrows. &ldquo;If that is true, why should he stay
      in this quiet place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Duval experienced a momentary embarrassment. &ldquo;Oh, the place is
      right enough. He stays, no doubt, because he likes it. You might as well
      ask why old Mr. Whitmel stays here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of mentioning a clergyman in this connection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Whitmel is professionally busy,&rdquo; cried Alicia. &ldquo;He told me that he is
      studying 'the disintegration of a soul.' I hope it is not <i>my</i> soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phrase probably interested Alicia in her idleness, for she was
      certainly actuated by no view of a moral uplift in the character of
      Girard, the handsome gambler. She did not recognize a subtle cruelty in
      her system of universal fascination, but her vanity demanded constant
      tribute, and she was peculiarly absorbed in the effort to bring to her
      feet this man of iron, her knight in armor, as she was wont to call him,
      to control him with her influence, to bend this unmalleable material like
      the proverbial wax in her hands. She had great faith in the coercive power
      of her hazel eyes, and she brought their batteries to bear on Girard on
      the first occasion when she had him at her mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard something about you which is very painful,&rdquo; she said one day
      as they sat together beside the chalybeate spring. The crag, all
      discolored in rust-red streaks by the dripping of the mineral water
      through its interstices, towered above their heads; the ferns, exquisite
      and of subtle fragrance, tufted the niches; the trees were close about
      them, and below, on the precipitous slope; sometimes the lush green boughs
      parted, revealing a distant landscape of azure ranges, far stretching
      against a sky as blue, and in the valley of the foreground long bars of
      golden hue, where fields, denuded of the harvested wheat, took the sun.
      Girard lounged, languid, taciturn, and quiescent as ever, on the opposite
      side of the circular rock basin wherein the clear water fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what it is,&rdquo; Alicia went on, after a pause, for, though
      he looked attentive, he gave not even a glance of question. &ldquo;I hear that
      you gamble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gaze concentrated as he knitted his brows, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled her broad straw hat forward on her auburn hair and readjusted
      the flounces of her white morning dress, saying while thus engaged, &ldquo;Yes,
      indeed; that you gamble&mdash;like&mdash;like fury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you know that's against the law?&rdquo; he demanded unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that it is very wrong and sinful,&rdquo; she said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanky. I'll put that in my pipe an' smoke it! I'm very wrong and sinful,
      I am given to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I didn't mean <i>you</i> so much,&rdquo; she faltered, perturbed by this
      sudden charge of the enemy. &ldquo;I meant the practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know that I'm a sinner in more ways 'n one; but I <i>didn't</i>
      know that you were a lady-preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that it is none of my business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be so glad of that,&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She maintained a silence that might have suggested a degree of offended
      pride, and she was truly humiliated that her vaunted hazel eyes had so
      signally failed to work their wonted charm. As they strolled back together
      up the steep path to the hotel he seemed either unobservant or uncaring,
      so impassive were his manners, and she was aware that her demonstration
      had resulted in giving him information which he could not otherwise have
      gained. Later, she was nettled to notice that he had utilized it in
      prosaic fashion, for that night no lights flared late from the casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gamesters, informed that rumors were a-wing, had betaken themselves
      elsewhere. A small smoking-room in the hotel proper seemed less obnoxious
      to suspicion in the depleted condition of the guest-list, since autumn was
      now approaching. After eleven o'clock the coterie would scarcely be
      subject to interruption, and there they gathered as the hour waxed late.
      The cards were duly dealt, the draw was on, when suddenly the door opened
      and old Mr. Whitmel, his favorite meerschaum in his hand and a sheaf of
      newly arrived journals, entered with the evident intention of a prolonged
      stay. A &ldquo;standpatter&rdquo; seemed hardly so assured as before he encountered
      the dim, surprised gaze, but the old clergyman was esteemed a good sort,
      and he ventured on a reminder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been here before, haven't you, Mr. Whitmel? Saw a deal of this
      sort of thing in the army!&rdquo; And he rattled the chips significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used to see that sort of thing in the army? Yes, yes, indeed&mdash;more
      than I wanted to see&mdash;very much more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Duval took schooling much amiss. He turned up his florid face with
      its auburn mustachios and Burnside whiskers from its bending over the
      cards and showed a broad arch of glittering white teeth in an ungenial
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Mr. Whitmel, at that fight we had in the hills not far from the
      Ocoee, how you rebuked two artillerymen for swearing? Something was wrong
      with the vent-hole of the piece, and one of the gunners asked what
      business you had with their language; and you said, 'I am a minister of
      the Lord,' and the fellow gave it back very patly, 'I ain't carin' ef you
      was a minister of state!' Then you said, 'No, you would doubtless swear in
      the presence of an angel.' And the fellow with the sponge-staff declared,
      'Say, Mister, ef you are <i>that</i>, you are an angel off your feed
      certain'&mdash;you were worn to skin and bone then&mdash;'an' the rations
      of manna must be ez skimpy in heaven ez the rations o' bacon down here in
      Dixie.' Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Whitmel had taken a seat in an easy-chair; he had struck a match and
      was composedly kindling his pipe. &ldquo;I felt nearer a higher communion that
      day than often since,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coterie of gentlemen looked at one another in disconsolate
      uncertainty, and one turned his cards face downward and laid them
      resignedly on the table. The party was evidently in for one of the old
      chaplain's long stories, with a few words by way of application, and there
      was no decent opportunity to demur. They were the intruders in the
      smoking-room&mdash;not he! Here with his pipe and his paper, he was within
      the accommodation assigned him. They must hie them back to the casino to
      be at ease, and this would they do when he should reach the end of his
      story&mdash;if indeed it had an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For with the prolixity of the eye-witness he was detailing the points of
      the battle; what troops were engaged; how the flank was turned; how the
      reserve was delayed; how the guns were planted; how the cavalry was
      ordered to charge over impracticable ground, and how in consequence he saw
      a squadron literally annihilated; how for hours after the fight was over a
      sergeant of the Dovinger Rangers pervaded the field with the guidon,
      calling on them by name to rally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, turning in his chair, the fire kindling in
      his eyes as it died in the bowl of his pipe, &ldquo;not one man responded, for
      none could rise from that horrid slaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of tense silence. Then, &ldquo;Back and forth the guidon
      flaunted, and the rain began to fall, and the night came on, and still the
      dusk echoed the cry, 'Guide right! Dovinger's Rangers! Rally on the
      guidon! Rally on the reserve!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old chaplain stuck his pipe into his mouth and brought it aflare again
      with two or three strong indrawing respirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The surgeons said it would end in a case of dementia. I was sorry, for I
      had seen much that day that hurt me, and more than all was this. For I
      could picture that valiant young spirit going through life, spared by
      God's mercy; and it seemed to me that when the enemy, in whatever guise,
      should press him hard and defeat should bear him down he would have the
      courage and the ardor and the moral strength to rally on the reserve. He
      would rally on the guidon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old chaplain pulled strongly at his pipe, setting the blue wreaths of
      smoke circling about his head. &ldquo;I should know that young fellow again
      wherever I might chance to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he collapse at last and verify the surgeon's prophecy!&rdquo; asked the
      dealer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled the chaplain, with a little flattered laugh, &ldquo;I myself
      took care of that Many years ago I studied medicine, before I was favored
      with a higher call. Neurology was my line. When the boy's horse sank
      exhausted beneath him, and he fell into a sleep or stupor on the carcass,
      I removed the object of the obsession. I slipped the flag-staff, guidon
      and all, into a crevice of the rocks, where it will remain till the end of
      our time, be sure.&rdquo; He laughed in relish of his arbitrary intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a fine healthy clamor in camp the next morning about the lost
      guidon. But I did the soldier no damage, for he had been promoted to a
      lieutenancy for special gallantry on the field, and he therefore could no
      longer have carried the guidon if he had had both the flag and the troop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stories of camp and field, thus begun, swiftly multiplied; they wore
      the fire to embers, and the oil sank low in the lamps. There was a chill
      sense of dawn in the blue-gray mist when the group, separating at last,
      issued upon the veranda; the moon, so long hovering over the sombre
      massive mountains, was slowly sinking in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the shadows of the pillars a tall, martial figure lurked in ambush
      for the old chaplain, as he rounded the corner of the veranda on his way
      to his own quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa'son,&rdquo; a husky voice spoke from out the dim comminglement of the mist
      and the moon, &ldquo;'twas me that carried that guidon in Dovinger 's Bangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; declared the triumphant tactician. &ldquo;<i>I</i> recognized you
      as soon as I saw you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm through with this,&rdquo; the young mountaineer exclaimed abruptly, with
      an eloquent gesture of renunciation toward the deserted card-table visible
      through the vista of open doors. &ldquo;I'm going home&mdash;to work! I'll never
      forget that I was marker in Dovinger's Rangers. I carried the guidon! And
      that last day I marked their way to glory! There's nothing left of them
      except honor and duty, but I'll rally on that, Chaplain. Never fear for
      me, again. I'll rally on the reserve!&rdquo;
